@[edit-confs step]
Now, we need to set up our partitions so the system will find them again on
bootup. For this, edit @[/mnt/root/etc/fstab] and add your partitions.

(For editors available on this iso, do @[help editors])

Also, take a look at the files in @[/mnt/root/etc/sysconfig/] and edit any you
feel should be different. Especially, you should make sure the @[facilities] file
looks correct, and if you selected a custom keymap at the start of this
install, you'll need to edit the file called @[keymap] in that directory
(do @[ cat /tmp/selected-keymap] to see which you chose).

You may also wish to create @[/mnt/root/etc/hostname] with a hostname for your
system, and you can set up networking by editing the
@[/mnt/root/etc/network/interfaces] file.

Finally, you can choose to set your timezone by doing the following:
@[ smgl-chroot]
@[ ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/SOME/TIMEZONE /etc/localtime]

Just remember to replace "SOME/TIMEZONE" with your actual timezone.

Type @[next] to go to the next step.
