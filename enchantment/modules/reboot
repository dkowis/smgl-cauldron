@[reboot step]
You should be all done with the installation! Congratulations! Time to reboot
into your installed system! Just type:

@[ reboot]

If you installed @[smgl-setup] (installed by default unless changed), be sure to
run @[man smgl-setup] when first logging in. It will provide you with
information on what you can do with your newly installed system.

We don't (yet) eject the CD during shutdown, so be sure to take it out during
reboot or configure your BIOS not to try and boot from it.
