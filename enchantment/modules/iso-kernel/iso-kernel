@[iso-kernel step]
Installing the ISO kernel is easy, and it should work well (it's working on
your computer right now). To install the ISO kernel, all you need to do is copy
the kernel and kernel modules over to your new system. You can do this with a
script we provide, or manually. Remember to modify your bootloader
configuration to use the kernel you install if you wish to boot it!

using smgl-kernel:
@[ smgl-kernel]

manually:
copy the kernel itself:
@[ cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) /mnt/root/boot/]
@[ cp /boot/linux /mnt/root/boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r)]

copy all the kernel modules:
@[ cp -a /lib/modules/$(uname -r) /mnt/root/lib/modules/]

you'll probably also want the modprobe blacklist:
@[ cp /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist /mnt/root/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist]

Type @[next] to go to the next step.
