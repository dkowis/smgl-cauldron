@[disk-mount step]
You need to mount the filesystems. We'll be installing to /mnt/root,
so mount the filesystem that will be / onto /mnt/root. The partitions given are
only examples. Replace them with the partitions you used in @[disk-format].

Examples:
@[ mount -t ext2 /dev/sda1 /mnt/root]
@[ mount -t reiserfs /dev/sda1 /mnt/root]
@[ mount -t xfs /dev/sda1 /mnt/root]

Then mount any other partitions you made at the proper subdirectories.
You'll probably need to make directories for the other mount points first
(assuming you formatted the / partition). Make sure you mount / first.

For example, if you created /dev/sda2 for /usr:
@[ mkdir /mnt/root/usr]
@[ mount -t ext2 /dev/sda2 /mnt/root/usr]
(or, for example, if it's a jfs partition)
@[ mount -t jfs /dev/sda1 /mnt/root]

Don't forget to mount @[all] the (system) partitions you plan to use.
Also, you may want to turn on swap via e.g.
@[ swapon /dev/sda2]
