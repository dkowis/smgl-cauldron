@[lilo step]:
Edit @[/mnt/root/etc/lilo.conf] to your setup (especially, you'll want to change
the boot= and root= entries to point to your partitions, and you'll need to
set the kernel version correctly).

To run lilo properly, it needs to be chroot'ed into the new system. This needs
some directories (/dev, /proc), so we provide a wrapper to set those up for
you and clean them up again when you're done.

Run the script to get a shell inside the installed system:
@[ smgl-chroot]

Then run lilo so it updates the boot record:
@[ /sbin/lilo]

Exit the chroot:
@[ exit]

Unless you got an error message when you were installing the boot loader,
you should be done with this step. Type @[next] to go to the next step.
