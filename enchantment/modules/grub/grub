@[grub step]:
To run grub properly, it needs to be chroot'ed into the new system.

chroot into the system:
@[ smgl-chroot]

Copy all the necessary grub files to /boot:
cp /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc/* /boot/grub

Then run grub and enter the following commands, without the > in front (adjust
for your disk layout):
@[ /sbin/grub]
> @[root (hd0,0)]
> @[setup (hd0)]
> @[quit]

Update menu.lst for your kernel:
$EDITOR /boot/grub/menu.lst

Exit the chroot:
@[ exit]

Type @[next] to go to the next step.
