@[disk-partition step]
First, we'll need to create some partitions on your disk that we can install
SMGL to. You'll need to know the device of your hard disk to do this. One good
way to find your disks is by ls /sys/block, running cat /proc/partitions, or by
dmesg | grep -i disk. You probably want something that is either hd or sd.

This image ships with several popular programs for partitioning:

cfdisk is probably the most popular, a curses-based menu system:
@[ cfdisk /dev/sda]

parted can resize partitions, but may be a tad confusing:
@[ parted /dev/sda]

Then for the purists there's plain line-based fdisk. Can be a bit hard to use:
@[ fdisk /dev/sda]

The iso also ships with @[sfdisk], if you're insane enough to want to use
it.

Remember to save your new partitioning scheme before quitting the program,
create a swap partition, and remember you can always see this screen again
by typing @[todo]. Type @[next] when you're done.
