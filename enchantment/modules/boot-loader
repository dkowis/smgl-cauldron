@[boot-loader step]
Now it is time to set up a boot loader. Since this is the x86 ISO, you can
set up either grub or lilo. Use whichever you please, but only use one of them.
It is assumed that whichever boot loader you will set up here was selected and
installed during the @[select-spells] and @[install] steps.

Once you have decided which boot loader to set up, you need to configure the
boot loader. After you finish configuring your boot loader, you need to
"install" it.  This involves running the boot loader, which will install itself
to the location you specified in the config file.

For lilo instructions, type @[todo lilo].

For grub instructions, type @[todo grub].

To see the instructions for this step again, just type @[todo].

When you are finished, type @[next].
