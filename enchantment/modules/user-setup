@[user-setup step]
To set up users, chroot into the target system as for the bootloader step:
@[ smgl-chroot]

Set a password for the root user (pick a secure one, but not one you'll forget,
and bear in mind that it can be bypassed with a screwdriver):
@[ passwd root]

@[Recommended]: add at least one regular user for daily use:
@[ useradd -m -d /home/mbolton ]-g users@[ mbolton]
@[ passwd mbolton]

Replace mbolton with whatever login you want. Don't forget to change
/home/mbolton accordingly. You may also change the group (-g users).

Finally, exit the chroot to return to the installer:
@[ exit]
