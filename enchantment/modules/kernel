@[kernel]
You can install the ISO kernel (fast and easy), set up a custom kernel
(recommended), or both (best of both worlds). Whatever you choose, you must
install at least one kernel.

For instructions on how to install the ISO kernel, type @[todo iso-kernel].

For instructions on how to install a custom kernel, type @[todo compile-kernel].

To see the instructions for this step again, just type @[todo].

When you are finished, type @[next].
