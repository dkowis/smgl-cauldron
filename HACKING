This file describes the layout of the project, and how the different components
interconnect with each other.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
cauldron/

	Code for cauldron, the ISO generation script(s).

************
* cauldron *
************
	This is the interface to all the different libraries. It accepts user
input, and (when later implemented) presents an interface for modifying the
cauldron config file. It will have both a command-line interface and a
menu-driven interface (via dialog), much like sorcery.

***************
* libcauldron *
***************
	This is the main cauldron library. It is responsible for managing
initialization and final cleanup and for providing functionality common to all
the cauldron sub-libraries.

**************
* lib.chroot *
**************
	The lib.chroot library is responsible for setting up, tearing down, and
calling into chroots. The code in this module gets used many times both in the
other modules (in particular libcauldron) and in cauldron itself (particularly
for the brew command).

************
* lib.init *
************
	The lib.init library handles the init system for the ISO. It provides
functions for creating an initramfs/initrd and for setting up the ISO inittab
for booting into the correct enchant setup (i.e. putting the menu installer on
tty1 and the shell installer on all the remaining tty's). It will also set up
other necessary init scripts (and possibly the init system itself, if this is
needed), though these should really be taken care of via sorcery and casting
spells with their init scripts enabled.

*****************
* lib.sorcerous *
*****************
	The lib.sorcerous library provides an interface to sorcery components
and functions as they are needed within cauldron. This includes functions which
source sorcery files in the target, as well as functions to download and
install sorcery into the target.

*****************
* lib.toolchain *
*****************
	The lib.toolchain library provides functions for generating the base
toolchain used to build all the components that will make up the final ISO.


**************
* errorcodes *
**************
	Defines the cauldron-specific error codes and corresponding messages to
be used for error-checking via liberror functions.


*************
* cleaners/ *
*************
	This directory contains text files that list files to be removed from
the final ISO, one file per line (note: files, not spells!). For example, the
build toolchain is removed from the ISO before it is packaged, but it is not
simply dispelled. Instead, it is removed via the cleaners, since some of the
toolchain libraries are needed for runtime binaries (such as libstdc++), even
though the build tools themselves are not. No build tools should be on the ISO!
Their spell caches are provided instead, and they are to be accessed from the
installed platform.


**************
* etc/config *
**************
	The config file contains all the global variables used by the cauldron
scripts used to build an ISO that can be user-configured. Like the sorcery
config file(s), etc/cauldron/config is the main (default) config file, and
etc/cauldron/local/config is meant to contain modified or custom values.  For
any setting found in both config files, the etc/cauldron/local/config file
overrides what is in etc/cauldron/config.

********************
* etc/$ARCH/spells *
********************
	A list of all the spells necessary for the ISO runtime to function.
These are all basic spells, like bash for example. Later we will likely also
have arch-specific spell lists, since different archs will need, for example,
different boot loaders (grub and lilo are only for x86). The spell list is used
by libcauldron.

********************
* etc/$ARCH/caches *
********************
	A list of the spells which are necessary for a basic installed target
system. This should be as close to a minimal basesystem as possible. Anything
which is truly optional should be provided as spell sources rather than built
caches. All spells whose caches are provided on the ISO must also have their
sources provided on the ISO.

*********************
* etc/$ARCH/sources *
*********************
	A list of the spells which are not necessary for a basic installed
target system. These sources are provided for additional functionality, like
networking. Exclusion of a spell from this list does not imply exclusion of the
spell's sources from the ISO (cf. iso-caches.$ARCH, mentioned above).

***********************
* etc/$ARCH/toolchain *
***********************
	This is a list of all the spells needed for building the binaries to go
onto the ISO. It includes things like gcc, as well as arch-specific spells such
as bin86 for x86.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
lib/

	Code common to both cauldron and enchantment.

************
* libcolor *
************
	This library defines all the color codes and message type definitions
to be used by the cauldron and enchantment scripts, and functions to handle
setting the colors for the needed message types.

************
* liberror *
************
	This library defines all the error codes recognized by the cauldron
and enchantment scripts, and functions to handle the printing of error messages
using these codes. This is used by all the other scripts in the project.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
enchantment/

	Code for enchantment, the installer interface(s) used on the ISOs.

******************
* libenchantment *
******************
	This library provides common functions to be used across the different
ISO installers. Currently sourced by libcauldron, but likely will be sourced by
cauldron instead of libcauldron soon. It is also sourced by the different
installers, as it provides common functionality for them.

**************
* lib.potion *
**************
	This library provides state tracking functionality for enchantment. The
state tracking can be used for error-proofing installation procedures,
automating installs (or even portions of them, as it can function over ranges
of modules), and undo functionality if the functions are linked with the
history functionality provided by libenchantment. This library is sourced by
libenchantment.


**************
* errorcodes *
**************
	Defines the enchantment-specific error codes and corresponding messages to
be used for error-checking via liberror functions.


*********
* menu/ *
*********
	The menu installer (look at older ISOs (0.9.6.3 or earlier) for an idea
of what this is). Everything relevant to the menu installer goes under this
directory, to be copied onto the ISO later if the ISO is intended to make use
of this module.

**********
* shell/ *
**********
	The shell installer (as seen on the 0.10.0 ISOs). Everything relevant
to the shell installer goes under this directory, to be copied over to the ISO
later if the ISO is intended to use this installer. (Note: The ISO really
should have this installer! Whatever other installer is being used, this one is
highly stable and robust, and requires very little in the way of system
resources. It's a good backup if something goes wrong with another installer,
and has proven capable of being the only installer on the ISO as well. Other
installers are just eye-candy on top of this one.)

**********************
* $installer/modules *
**********************
	Each installer is required to have this file, which lists which modules
it will make use of, and the ordering of them.


**********************
* modules/help/index *
**********************
	When the user calls for help, the contents of this file should be
displayed, which show what commands are available to the user and what they do.
This should probably be moved into installer-specific files.

************************
* modules/help/editors *
************************
	This is a list of all the editors that are available on the ISO.
Different folks, different editing preferences. Never force your users to use
one editor.

***************************
* modules/welcome/welcome *
***************************
	This is the welcome message displayed directly after the ISO finishes
booting. It mentions how to proceed to the next steps, and also how to access
different keymaps. This should probably be moved to installer-specific files.


********************
* modules/$module/ *
********************
	Each module directory houses all the files needed for that given
module. Each of the files/directories associated with a module are dealt with
in turn below.

***************************
* modules/$module/$module *
***************************
	These are the actual instructions that would be presented to the user.
The file includes a very simplistic markup to designate text which should be
highlighted (commands, headings, etc.). The markup is replaced at runtime to
display in the desired state (for the shell, escape codes either representing
bold or a color if libcolor is loaded).

********************************
* modules/$module/$module.info *
********************************
	This is the short summary info for the module displayed when the list
of modules is given (i.e., the shell installer's "steps" command).

**************************
* modules/$module/enter/ *
**************************
	This is a collection of scripts to run when the user enters the module.
Typically these scripts are used for preparatory work, such as ensuring that
module-specific temporary files exist and have needed start values, but could
do anything that needs to be executed at the start of a module. These scripts
are not passed any arguments, so they must be fully autonomous.

*************************
* modules/$module/exit/ *
*************************
	This is a collection of scripts to run when the user exits the module.
Typically these scripts are used for cleanup work, such as writing out final
values to the module-specific temporary files, but could do anything that needs
to be executed at the end of a module. These scripts are not passed any
arguments, so they must be fully autonomous.

***************************
* modules/$module/potion/ *
***************************
	This is the collection of scripts responsible for automating the
process of the module. Each script in this directory must take one argument,
which is the path to the potion to use for automating the module.


**************
* etc/config *
**************
	The config file contains all the global variables used by the enchantment
scripts used during the ISO runtime that can be user-configured. Like the
sorcery config file(s), etc/cauldron/config is the main (default) config file,
and etc/cauldron/local/config is meant to contain modified or custom values.
For any setting found in both config files, the etc/cauldron/local/config file
overrides what is in etc/cauldron/config.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ward/

	A collection of scripts for performing quality assurance on the
Cauldron codebase.

*************************
* ward/cauldron_sources *
*************************
	Defines an array which lists all the cauldron sources to scan using the
wards.

****************************
* ward/enchantment_sources *
****************************
	Defines an array which lists all the enchantment sources to scan using
the wards.


****************
* ward/libward *
****************
	Defines the various functions that are used to perform each ward's
checks.


******************
* ward/functions *
******************
	Performs a static analysis of function calls in files passed on the
command line, testing if they are defined first in the file being checked and
then in the different libraries in the respective component, checking from
outer prefix to inner.

*************************
* ward/global_variables *
*************************
	Performs a static analysis of global variables (the uppercased ones) in
files passed on the command line against a "definition" file (typically this
would either be one of the etc/config files, or one of the errorcodes files).

************************
* ward/local_variables *
************************
	Performs a static analysis of local variables (the lowercased ones
defined with the "local" keyword) in files passed on the command line against
the file being checked to ensure that the variable is properly defined within
the scope it is being used in, and before the variable is used.


*****************
* ward/ward-all *
*****************
	Runs all wards on the cauldron and enchantment sources. This should be
used for any "release" which is done to ensure both that the code is compliant
with the API and that there is higher quality of the code (bug prevention is
better than bug fixing).

************************
* ward/ward-configvars *
************************
	Tests the use of all configuration variables (global variables which
aren't error codes) in all cauldron and enchantment sources (as defined in
cauldron_sources and enchantment_sources above) to ensure that they are
properly defined in the respective configuration files.

************************
* ward/ward-errorcodes *
************************
	Tests both the internal consistency of the cauldron and enchantment
errorcodes files (makes sure that the number of codes matches the number of
messages and that every code has a corresponding message and vice versa), and
the use of all error codes in all cauldron and enchantment sources (as defined
in cauldron_sources and enchantment_sources above) to ensure that they are
properly defined in the respective errorcodes files.

***********************
* ward/ward-functions *
***********************
	Tests all function calls in all cauldron and enchantment sources (as
defined in cauldron_sources and enchantment_sources above) to ensure that they
are properly defined.

***********************
* ward/ward-localvars *
***********************
	Tests all local variables in all cauldron and enchantment sources (as
defined in cauldron_sources and enchantment_sources above) to ensure that they
are properly defined.
