This file describes the layout of the project, and how the different components
interconnect with each other.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
cauldron/

	Code for cauldron, the ISO generation script(s).

************
* cauldron *
************
	This is the interface to all the different libraries. It accepts user
input, and (when later implemented) presents an interface for modifying the
cauldron config file. It will have both a command-line interface and a
menu-driven interface (via dialog), much like sorcery.

***************
* libcauldron *
***************
	This is the real work-horse. It directly handles the building of
packages (including setting up cross-compiler toolchains), , etc. This is
sourced by the cauldron script. It itself sources the liberror library (for
returning error codes back to the calling script, in this case the cauldron
script) and the cauldron sublibraries (e.g., lib.chroot, lib.init, etc.).

**************
* lib.chroot *
**************
	The lib.chroot module is responsible for setting up, tearing down, and
calling into chroots. The code in this module gets used many times both in the
other modules (in particular libcauldron) and in cauldron itself (particularly
for the brew command).

*****************
* lib.hostcache *
*****************
	The lib.hostcache module provides functions for generating spell caches
using the host system. If the host sorcery doesn't have ARCHIVE turned on, or
if the cache file for a needed spell was deleted from the host system, then it
will need to be generated before it can be used in the build chroot. Note that
caches from the host system are only used to set up an initial build toolchain,
which will then be used to produce a build toolchain specific to the target
system the ISO is to be built for.

***********
* lib.init *
***********
	The lib.init module handles the init system for the ISO. It provides
functions for creating an initramfs/initrd and for setting up the ISO inittab
for booting into the correct enchant setup (i.e. putting the menu installer on
tty1 and the shell installer on all the remaining tty's). It will also set up
other necessary init scripts (and possibly the init system itself, if this is
needed), though these should really be taken care of via sorcery and casting
spells with their init scripts enabled.

*****************
* lib.sorcerous *
*****************
	The lib.sorcerous module provides an interface to sorcery components
and functions as they are needed within cauldron. This includes functions which
source sorcery files in the target, as well as functions to download and
install sorcery into the target.

**************
* errorcodes *
**************
	Defines the cauldron-specific error codes and corresponding messages to
be used for error-checking via liberror functions.

*************
* cleaners/ *
*************
	This directory contains text files that list files to be removed from
the final ISO, one file per line (note: files, not spells!). For example, the
build toolchain is removed from the ISO before it is packaged, but it is not
simply dispelled. Instead, it is removed via the cleaners, since some of the
toolchain libraries are needed for runtime binaries (such as libstdc++), even
though the build tools themselves are not. No build tools should be on the ISO!
Their spell caches are provided instead, and they are to be accessed from the
installed platform.

***********************
* etc/cauldron/config *
***********************
	The config file contains all the global variables used by the cauldron
scripts used to build an ISO that can be user-configured. Like the sorcery
config file(s), etc/cauldron/config is the main (default) config file, and
etc/cauldron/local/config is meant to contain modified or custom values.  For
any setting found in both config files, the etc/cauldron/local/config file
overrides what is in etc/cauldron/config.

*****************************
* etc/cauldron/$ARCH/spells *
*****************************
	A list of all the spells necessary for the ISO runtime to function.
These are all basic spells, like bash for example. Later we will likely also
have arch-specific spell lists, since different archs will need, for example,
different boot loaders (grub and lilo are only for x86). The spell list is used
by libcauldron.

*****************************
* etc/cauldron/$ARCH/caches *
*****************************
	A list of the spells which are necessary for a basic installed target
system. This should be as close to a minimal basesystem as possible. Anything
which is truly optional should be provided as spell sources rather than built
caches. All spells whose caches are provided on the ISO must also have their
sources provided on the ISO.

******************************
* etc/cauldron/$ARCH/sources *
******************************
	A list of the spells which are not necessary for a basic installed
target system. These sources are provided for additional functionality, like
networking. Exclusion of a spell from this list does not imply exclusion of the
spell's sources from the ISO (cf. iso-caches.$ARCH, mentioned above).

********************************
* etc/cauldron/$ARCH/toolchain *
********************************
	This is a list of all the spells needed for building the binaries to go
onto the ISO. It includes things like gcc, as well as arch-specific spells such
as bin86 for x86.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
lib/

	Code common to both cauldron and enchantment.

************
* liberror *
************
	This library defines all the error codes recognized by the cauldron
scripts, and functions to handle the printing of error messages using these
codes. This is used by all the other scripts in the project.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
enchantment/

	Code for enchantment, the installer interface(s) used on the ISOs.

******************
* libenchantment *
******************
	This library provides common functions to be used across the different
ISO installers. Currently sourced by libcauldron, but likely will be sourced by
cauldron instead of libcauldron soon. It is also sourced by the different
installers, as it provides common functionality for them.


**************
* errorcodes *
**************
	Defines the enchantment-specific error codes and corresponding messages to
be used for error-checking via liberror functions.

********************
* enchantment/menu *
********************
	The menu installer (look at older ISOs (0.9.6.3 or earlier) for an idea
of what this is). Everything relevant to the menu installer goes under this
directory, to be copied onto the ISO later if the ISO is intended to make use
of this module.

*********************
* enchantment/shell *
*********************
	The shell installer (as seen on the 0.10.0 ISOs). Everything relevant
to the shell installer goes under this directory, to be copied over to the ISO
later if the ISO is intended to use this installer. (Note: The ISO really
should have this installer! Whatever other installer is being used, this one is
highly stable and robust, and requires very little in the way of system
resources. It's a good backup if something goes wrong with another installer,
and has proven capable of being the only installer on the ISO as well. Other
installers are just eye-candy on top of this one.)

**************************
* etc/enchantment/config *
**************************
	The config file contains all the global variables used by the enchantment
scripts used during the ISO runtime that can be user-configured. Like the
sorcery config file(s), etc/cauldron/config is the main (default) config file,
and etc/cauldron/local/config is meant to contain modified or custom values.
For any setting found in both config files, the etc/cauldron/local/config file
overrides what is in etc/cauldron/config.
