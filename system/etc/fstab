# /etc/fstab: static file system information.

# Add your file systems here.

# Examples:
#/dev/hda2	/	reiserfs	defaults,noatime	0 1
#/dev/hda1	/boot	ext2		defaults		0 2
#/dev/hda3	swap	swap		defaults		0 0

# The schema is
# <device> <mountpoint> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>
# and is roughly executed as
# mount -t <type> -o <options> <device> <mountpoint>

# Note that, except for /, these need to be in "logical order" -
# if you have both /usr and /usr/local, put /usr before /usr/local

# For more information, see "man 5 fstab" from the man-pages spell.
# also see fstab.examples for more examples from the smgl community.
