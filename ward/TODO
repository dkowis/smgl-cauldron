add ISO runtime/build tests
	test for all necessary runtime spells
	test for all necessary install caches
	test for all necessary install sources
	test for enchantment and enchantment init environment
		enchantment should be smart about this itself, as long as all
		its files are intact and present in the correct paths
	test for presence and validity of initramfs/ramdisk

add SYS build tests
	test for kernel source availability/location/linking
	test for all necessary runtime spells
	test validity of SYS compiler toolchain
		can be accomplished by compiling a very small program and
		testing its output (for non-crossbuild cases), as well as
		running file on the compiled binary to ensure that it is built
		for the correct architecture
