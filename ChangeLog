	* NPTL
	* udev

	  mkreiserfs binary is no more missing on ISO so you can choose to create a
	  reiserfs partition
	  More complete keymap selection
	  You can do a "cast linux" and select 2.6.8.1 kernel version (it wasn't
	  possible with 2.6.5-rc3-ben0)

2004-07-05 Javier 'de_Moya' Lopez Baeza <JavierLopezBaeza@hotmail.com>

2004-04-14 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* 20040414 ISO released
	* smgl.install: fix list_parts and list_raid_parts so double digit
	  partitions don't cause errors.
	  Change find_grub_target to make and check for a specific file, or it
	  "can" detect another SMGL /boot partition.

2004-04-13 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* 20040413 ISO released
	* uses devel sorcery (only devel has latest INSTALL_ROOT, CROSS_INSTALL
	  fixes) users not wanting devel, should run sorcery and choose stable from
	  "Option" -> "Sorcery Branch"
	* isolinux boot screen updated and changed, default is 800x600 framebuffer
	  console, low resolution (non-framebuffer) mode availableby typing
	  "lowres", read the boot help for how to get other resolutions
	* initrd fixed to autodetect the cdrom it booted from and allow root
	  selection for rescue mode and then correct pivot_root function.
	  (thanks to Wolfgang "Worf" Scheicher)
	* /etc, /root, /var/lib/nfs, /var/log made writable to installer now that
	  the initrd functions properly. (recursive thanks to Worf still)
	* udev and sysfsutils added to 2.6.5 version (thanks to
	  Arwed "alleycat" von Merkatz for his udev work) selection of udev or
	  static during install (for 2.6.5 devfs is not included/supported)
	* now that 2.6 uses udev, the code I added to check if entries in
	  /etc/fstab were symlinks has been removed, which fixes
	  http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6338
	* netconf updated to fix bug with module names
	  http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6523
	* I was overzealous in trimming 260MB kernel sources down to 20+ for the
	  includes stub installed with the default kernel.
	  http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6523
	* general clean up of code, hints and comments, thanks to Ladislav Hagara
	  ( "lace" ) http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6411
	* ppp and pppoe and wireless_tools now in iso_root
	  http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6321
	* which now in iso_root http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6320
	* partition naming should now show partitions as Type "unknown" if the size
	  and type check fails http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6542
	* vim added as optional install, jed and slang removed from iso_root and
	  only the selected editor installed
	  http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6531
	* reworded hint per mounting and formatting
	  http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6468
	* bug in restart function, deleting raidtab before stopping and unmounting
	  the running arrays. http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6309
	* only used fs and networks spells now installed, final closure of
	  http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4626
	* ppp configuration errors fixed
	  http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3491
	* grub added to installer, choice of lilo or grub now for x86 installs and
	  simple query if wanted installed to MBR or not (editing no longer
	  necessary, is still possible though)
	  http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2184
	* removed the sis drm module from the 2.4.25 kernel
	  http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5727
	* dialog usage of --defaultno fixed in installer so anything that needs
	  confirmation now defaults to the no button (much safer and more convenient
	  for minimum install)
	* image.tar.bz2 is dead! long live /var/cache/sorcery/* !
	  http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3497
	  Installer rewritten to only force installation of the minimum necessary, and
	  give a selection of optional spells, then install minimum and optional
	  spells and their depends.
	* The installer order has been changed, transfer of spells now happens after
	  configuration and the configuration is guided, after each stage is
	  successfully completed, the installer will highlight the next stage,
	  leaving the user to only press enter.
	* installer uses sorcery's CROSS_INSTALL to setup sorcery on the new system
	  http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6329
	* The configuration happens after mounting of the filesystems (and swap), and
	  while configuring, the installer is copying files as a background process.
	  Sorcery, the stable grimoire, the sources on the ISO, some minimum
	  binaries/libraries needed for the actual install, plus any files that
	  sorcery doesn't currently track (POST_INSTALL created files and/or files
	  sorcery lost "track" of when the spell was rebuilt during the ISO
	  manufacture) are copied in the background process after a prompt is answered
	  when setting up the box's timezone.
	* install.guide updated to show the new installer's flow

2004-04-12 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* kernel.help: moved into a separate file that the installer reads, it can
	  be updated without affecting installer now.
	* smgl.install: simple hack if uptimed installed, and make maildir.
	  Made many menus radiolists so the choice was selectable without hitting
	  enter and closing the screen. Rerun grub if reconfiguring, so it can be
	  loaded to MBR if that option changes

2004-04-09 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: make some menus radiolist, so you can toggle selection on
	  and off reordered grub lilo stuff, removed some unnecessary functions,
	  slightly changed the partitioning and raid hints for bootloader. check
	  for deps of EDITOR and install REAL_ED (onle nano and elvis in iso_root
	  so EDITOR and REAL_ED are different altered kernel compile hint.
	* bootmisc: the script with commands to free initrd memory for the installer

2004-04-07 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* srcmage.txt: the txt file read by isolinux
	* isolinux.cfg: isolinux config
	* f1.txt: graphical modes readable from isolinux prompt
	* smgl.init: changes for 2.6 kernel modules
	* mountall.sh: Updated to work with Arweds %DEV runlevel
	* config-2.?.X: moving 2.4.25 and 2.6.5 configs into the spell dir
	* smgl.install: mucho bueno changes, probably too many for a single
	  submission, but ... ?
	  Remove image.tar.bz2.
	  Add two lists (etc/installerdata/*-list), one with defaults and second
	  with list of optional spells,all spells (except for some untracked files)
	  installed from /var/cache/sorcery/*.
	  udev or static dev query (2.6 only).
	  choice of lilo or grub added to installer, dialog query of whether to
	  install  $bootloader to MBR or not.
	  Reordered entire installer to install spells after configutation.
	  Run all configuration after mounting drives, but before install,
	  setup_target installs sorcery, makes static /dev entries and copies
	  untracked files in the background while the user continues configuring.
	  Fix ppp and pppoe configuration, offer to start all configurable
	  interfaces, after configuring them.
	  Copy /etc/skel/* to /root/* of the new install.
	  Change list_parts (and list_raid_parts) so if finding size and type fails
	  it continues instead of failing.
	  Make /dev/pts and /dev/shm (in case static /dev is chosen).
	  Move the raidtab from /tmp to /etc, functions and menu to select services
	  to start at boot (the only post install item).
	  Add vim to list of editors, but for duration of install alias vim and jed
	  to elvis.
	  Rename many, many variables from LINE and LIST (etc) to be more
	  reflective of their job.
	  More debugging added, some refinement.

2004-04-07 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: typos corrected, &&'s used to stop continuation when menu is
	  escaped grub and lilo fixes, udev fixes, untracked file fixes, change menu
	  item for kernel so it is escapable/cancellable; architecture, optimization
	  menus fixed

2004-04-02 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.init: pivot_root fixes, making writable dirs and new cdrom scan
	  function to find the installer

2004-04-01 Kevin Dahan <unet@sourcemage.org>
	* added alternate-smgl.init with hwd

2004-03-25 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: another string change for bug 6411

2004-03-24 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: some polishing touches thanks to lace (bug #6411)
	* smgl.install: remove extended partitions from the listings, add VERSION
	  and change location of the installation record file

2004-03-19 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: basic debugging, allows running through install without
	  running the destructive commands
	* smgl.install: forget the ${TARGET} prefix on a command, and netconf fix
	* smgl.install: DEBUG checks reversed in two cases, move some debug
	  reporting out so it always gets recorded

2004-03-08 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* 2.4.25 config I last uploaded was wrong one. This one was used for 0.9.2

2004-03-05 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* 0.9.2 x86 ISO released
	* smgl.install: few polishing touches
	* smgl.init*: few polishing touches
	* ISO still based on previous versions as ISO spell is nowhere near
	  finished, but patch, diff, pcmcia-cs and lvm have been added to the
	  iso_root, future version will have better rescue capabilities.
	* 2.6.3 kernel available as a courtesy to those wanting a rescue cd for
	  their 2.6.X nptl systems.
	* cardmgr, all pcmcia modules and /etc/pcmcia config added to initrd (both
	  kernel versions) to hopefully allow pcmcia cdrom usage. No initrd menu
	  integration yet, but it is possible to load modules and have cardmgr
	  initialise devices.
	  ( bug http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1743 )
	* static device generation in /dev after image transfer
	  ( bug http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6104 )
	* addition of lvm binaries to iso_root. no installer menu integration, yet,
	  but a request was made to atleast get the binaries into the iso_root.
	  ( bug http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6266 )
	* restart function added to installer, so if a mistake is made, you no
	  longer need to reboot
	  ( bug http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3828 )
	* automatic software RAID generation from the menu
	  ( bug http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3562 )
	* /var/tmp directory installed and will no longer be a symlink to /tmp
	  ( bug http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5707 )
	* addition of item to select number of make jobs during install
	  ( bug http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2269)
	* swapfile generation moved out of guided menu, but  prompted for if no
	  swap found immediately before transferring the image. It is still
	  possible to cancel this and install with no swapfile or swap partition.
	  ( bug http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5607)
	* updated to latest netconf
	* changed partition and disk listings to show partition type and size in
	  blocks
	* considerable uncompressed size decrease made by removing almost 30MB of
	  unused locale and gconv files
	* menus adjusted to show all entries in existing window
	* grub sources added to ISO, I have no experience with grub so haven't
	  integrated it's choice into the menu yet, future versions will have choice
	  of grub or lilo as bootloader.
	* reworked the "optional kernel compile" option, configuring the kernel is
	  no longer optional. Now a screen gives a choice of compiling a kernel or
	  copying the kernel used to boot the ISO. If "Default" is chosen the
	  kernel is copied and a set of configured includes unpacked to
	  /usr/src/linux-`uname -r` if "Compile" is chosen then normal cast -c
	  linux is run.
	* install.guide has been updated for the new options and moved to a generic
	  /etc/installerdata directory in preparation for the ISO spell. Many thanks
	  to Seth for his work on that file.

2004-03-03 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: tested and works for both 2.4 series and 2.6 series
	* smgl.init-4_2.6: 2.6 version of the initrd's linuxrc needed a few tweaks
	* MAKEDEV: actually add the script

2004-02-29 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* MAKEDEV: add a script and a few lines to installer to generate static
	  /dev entries

2004-02-28 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* added 2.4.25 and 2.6.3 configs

2004-02-25 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* lots of files: moved into the kickstart-spell
	* config-2.6.1: added for Worf
	* smgl.install: added make jobs configuration to the optimisation item,
	  test and remove raidtools, show block counts for partitions in the menu,
	  remove spaces from the partition lines, add some hints here and there
	  about possible actions within that screen. Change <cancel> to <Continue>
	  for first nls menu. modify uname output for the lilo generation

2004-02-23 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* mountall.sh-0.9.1: added the 0.9.1 version of this script
	* inittab: add this, not significantly different to the grimoire
	  version, but will save me generating it
	* /etc/*: add the raidlevel data and move things around so a cp will
	  work better

2004-02-22 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: need to test it but RAID should be functional from the menu

2004-02-20 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: RAID 90% added

2004-02-19 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: add menu item for restarting install from scratch and the
	  restart_install function (tested and working)
	* smgl.install: correct some typos
	* smgl.install: begin adding code for raid device generation

2004-02-18 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* ALL: add some files not generated by any spell, and some that differ
	  from regular files (for iso_root)

2004-02-14 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* config-2.4.24: updated to make some stuff statically.
	* smgl.install-using*blablabla: remove, was a backup only.
	* smgl.install: change swap + RAM requirements to recommendations.
	* smgl.install: change swapfile generation to only be prompted if a
	  dedicated swap partition isn't found when system transfer starts
	* kickstart-spell/*: some files needed to kickstart an installation.

2004-02-05 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* 0.9.1 ISO released
	* smgl.install
	* move fs dispelling to immediately post image transfer
	* move passwd changing similarly
	* add dispelling prompts for ppp and rp-pppoe
	* comment out cast of rp-pppoe now pppoe is included in image and add
	  chroot_cmd adsl-setup for pppoe configuration, amazed it was left broken
	  for so long
	* unset WASTAGE VAR incase someone chooses the wrong menu, and also check
	  it isn't an empty var, or dispel just opens less and waits for input.
	* sorcery 1.7.5
	* updated stable grimoire since 0.9.0 release
	* kernel 2.4.24 with XFS patches
	* Static support for USB input devices in installer kernel
	* initrd bug fixed http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5628

	  casting but no kernel recompile necessary
	  http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4614
	* pcmcia bus drivers compiled into installer kernel and pcmcia-ide/cdrom
	  drivers in initrd http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1743
	* Added choice of "no" system logger if wanted, gives final closure of
	  http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4627
	* /etc/login.defs now supports passwords longer than 8 characters and md5
	  encryption http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5507
	* /etc/services file corrected
	  http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5635
	* moved root password choice and dispelling of unwanted fs spells to
	  immediately post the image transfer
	  http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5630
	* Added dispelling prompts for ppp and rp-pppoe
	  http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4626
	* removed command to cast rp-pppoe (already installed by default) when
	  pppoe networking selected, instead it now runs adsl-setup (should solve
	  this bug) http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5597
	* removed mounting of /dev from /etc/fstab, added tmpfs mounting of
	  /var/run and /var/lock. The previous bug for this was misfiled, it is an
	  issue with mountall.sh script and will be addressed shortly and a new
	  version of init.d spell will be released
	  http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3597
	* Cleaner base system after install, devel section spells that have no
	  bearing on a compile of the kernel during install, or networking sources,
	  have been removed sample raidtab file included as /etc/raidtab.bak,
	  simply shell out ( or vt switch), copy it to /tmp, edit it as per simple
	  instructions within the file, run mkraid --configfile /tmp/raidtab.bak
	  <device>, then raidstart --configfile /tmp/raidtab.bak <device>.

2004-01-30 Laurent Wandrebeck <low@mren2.univ-littoral.fr>
	* 0.9.0 ISO released
	* Sorcery 1.7.5
	* Stable grimoire (20040128)
	* Linux 2.4.24 with XFS patches
	* You can now choose your system logger (sysklogd,metalog,syslog-ng)
	* Added root password choice at the end of installation (quick'n'dirty)
	* CPU selection for compilation optimization now works
	* Many modules available - don't forget to recompile if scsi is needed to
	  boot
	* Marled swapfile creation as optional
	* swapfile now defaults to /.swapfile
	* Cleaner base system after install (less unused spells installed)
	* added entries for cdrom and floppy in /etc/fstab (/mnt/floppy and
	  /mnt/cdrom)
	* ISO size: 200 MB. Packed ISO size: 139 MB. MD5 files provided for .iso
	  and .iso.bz2
	* feedback needed on raid, wireless, pcmcia. tools present, no menu (yet)

2004-01-26 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* added missing # to editor.sh and lc.sh script generation

2004-01-22 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* added smgl.install-using-proc-partitions-and-etc-profile.d-dir which
	  starts using /proc/partitions for partitions and disks (tested with a
	  raid install today) also puts EDITOR and LANG into .sh files in the
	  /etc/profile.d/ directory so the test spell can be integrated into
	  stable soon.
	* I specifically made this a second file because I was worried Unet
	  might be working on the other one (I am happy to merge/ change if he has)

2004-01-20 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* add smgl.install from 0.8.1 iso I made
	* add the config for the kernel I built, has more options turned on as
	  modules and some special features like raid fasttrak for promise
	  controllers that nee it turned on to use disks the bios can't see

2004-01-16 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* 0.8.1 x86 ISO released
	* latest stable grimoire (as of yesterday)
	* kernel 2.4.24 with XFS patches, more kernel modules built (agpgart, drm,
	  sound etc so the supplied kernel can actually be used for more than
	  bootstrapping)
	* simpleinit-msb 1.2 (buffer overflow bugfix)
	* netkit-ping (ping binary) added to both install and installer cd
	* dhcpcd binary added to installer cd
	* perl 5.8.2
	* xdelta, glib removed from install and sorcery options adjusted to suit
	  ed, parted removed (parted not needed after installation and already 3
	  editors installed)
	* unused networking spells dispelled when ethernet chosen
	* architecture,optimisation menu bug merged from Unet's ppc iso and use_gcc2    
	  error removed

2004-01-11 Kevin Dahan <unet@sourcemage.org>
	* 0.8.1 PPC ISO released
	* Using a 2.4.24-ben1 + XFS patched kernel, there should be no more problem
	  using either ext2/ext3/reiserfs/xfs (all tested on my powerbook)
	* Not subject to the recent simpleinit bug.
	* yaboot installer code is better: asks questions about your OpenFirmware
	  (OF) device (in most cases, it is the default, hd:2). If the yaboot.conf
	  generated should be ok in most cases, I *strongly* recommend checking the
	  yaboot.conf file afterwards, particularly the "partition" item, which
	  should point to your /.
	* keymap is working due to the use of a -ben kernel. hwclock is still *not*
	  functional.

2004-01-03 Kevin Dahan <unet@sourcemage.org>
	* 0.8.0 PPC ISO released
	* Everything works like the x86 version, EXCEPT:
	* No XFS support (as this cause problems with the ppc kernel),
	* You _MUST_ use either ext2 or ext3 as your / (you can, of course, use a
	  reiserfs or jfs for /home or what you want) - this is a yaboot bug.
	* There's some problem with keymap.sh (at least on my powerbook), so I
	  suggest *not* to activate it,
	* Same goes for hwclock.sh - both are deactivated by default.$
	* This iso is synced to 0.8 x86 version with current stable grimoire.

2003-12-20 Benoit PAPILLAULT <benoit.papillault@sourcemage.org> and Laurent Wandrebeck <low@mren2.univ-littoral.fr>

	  is not present (yet) should work better than pre1 (remember i'm only
	  temporary ISO guru, so don't hurt me ;))

2003-11-26 Benoit PAPILLAULT <benoit.papillault@sourcemage.org> and Laurent WANDREBECK <lwandrebeck@sourcemage.org>
	* 0.8.0-pre1 ISO released
	* biggest change is that gcc 3.3.2 is used.
	* sorcery 1.5 is used (which is the latest stable version)
	* isolinux 2.06 is used to boot the ISO.
	* kernel 2.4.22 with XFS patches (lots of modules, still some to add)
	* JFS support added (still broken, work in progress)

2003-10-25 Benoit PAPILLAULT <benoit.papillault@sourcemage.org>
	* 0.7.1 ISO released
	* biggest change is that devfs is now used on /dev and all necessary changes
	  have been made and tested
	* sorcery 1.4 is used (which is the latest stable version)
	* added /mnt/cdrom and /mnt/floppy mount points to image, iso_root, initrd
	* sources for driver of several ADSL modem have been added, but you still
	  need to compile and install them
	* there are nearly no alien files
	* <Cancel> menus during installation now work

2003-09-26 Benoit PAPILLAULT <benoit.papillault@sourcemage.org>
	* 0.7.0 ISO released (seemingly the same as 0.7.0-pre2)
	* 0.7.0-pre2 ISO released
	* nearly no alien files (glibc, perl, installwatch, init.d spell have been

	* KEYMAP in /etc/sysconfig/keymap now defaults to "us"
	* kernel compilation has been restored at install time and is optional
	  patched)

2003-09-11 Benoit PAPILLAULT <benoit.papillault@sourcemage.org>
	* 0.7.0-pre1 ISO released
	* major change: build only from sources based on stable grimoire
	* use simpleinit-msb/init.d instead of sysvinit
	* is less than 200 MB
	* initrd use glibc 2.3.2
	* initrd menu has been rewritten to ease module selection
	* initrd memory is corrected freed after use (8MB memory gain)
	* use kernel 2.4.21 + XFS patch
	* use gcc 3.2.3
	* corrected netconf bugs (tested only with Ethernet)

2003-06-16 Benoit PAPILLAULT <benoit.papillault@sourcemage.org> and Laurent WANDREBECK <lwandrebeck@sourcemage.org>
	* 0.6.0 ISO released (same as 0.6.0-test3)

2003-06-12 Benoit PAPILLAULT <benoit.papillault@sourcemage.org> and Laurent WANDREBECK <lwandrebeck@sourcemage.org>
	* 0.6.0-test3 ISO released
	* modified /usr/sbin/sgl.install to correct bug
	* correct bug #1074 (wrong /usr/src/linux/include

2003-06-06 Benoit PAPILLAULT <benoit.papillault@sourcemage.org> and Laurent WANDREBECK <lwandrebeck@sourcemage.org>
	* 0.6.0-test2 ISO released
	* removed kernel compilation, thus saving time
	* used a compressed initrd (initial ramdisk) thus reducing the ISO size
	  and enabling the use of initrd on 16Mb machines (correcting bug #3479)
	* added kernel support for FastTrack? RAID as module
	* added kernel support for Old Adaptec AIC7xxx as module (bug #2274)
	* added kernel support for RTC as module
	* added kernel support for VFAT as module
	* added kernel support for USB drive as module

2003-05-28 Benoit PAPILLAULT <benoit.papillault@sourcemage.org> and Laurent WANDREBECK <lwandrebeck@sourcemage.org>
	* 0.6.0-test1 ISO released
	* First test release of new iso building process:
	* added kernel support for machines with math coprocessor
	* added support for XFS filesystem, available at install time
	* added support for Eci modem (ADSL USB)
	* added support for Alcatel SpeedTouch? modem (ADSL USB)
	* updated sorcery
	* updated grimoire

2002-11-05 Adam Clark <adamsgl@dhbit.ca>
	* Beta1
	* Test RC1 grimoire
	* Sorcery > 0.9.0.1
	* gcc 3.2, glibc 2.3.1
	* i386 binaries
	* ISO runs on 2.4.19-xfs kernel
	* more modular kernel for install
	* slightly smaller ISO, package-wise. Still fully useable as a rescue CD.
	* Fits on a mini (180MB) CD-ROM

2002-07-01 Adam Clark <adamsgl@dhbit.ca>
	* A brand new test ISO has just been uploaded to the usual spot:
	  http://smgl.bccs.net/adam-test-isos - it's the Canada Day release! woohoo!
	  ;-)
	* What's more to cheer about is that all but 2 spells of the base-system
	  have been compiled with gcc3.  Sorcery has been updated to 0.1.7, and
	  many spells that are marked "USEGCC2" in the devel grimoire were
	  compiled with gcc3 to make the base system more gcc3 complete.
	* More information is on the download page, and please read the install
	  notes so that you can keep a new system mostly-gcc3 even after a rebuild.

2002-06-30 Adam Clark <adamsgl@dhbit.ca>
	* Finally... *finally* have fixed the /dev perm problems.  It's my own
	  stupid fault, too... Thank god we haven't called any of these ISOs
	  "production releases".  =)
	* Not too much else to report about it other than sorcery/grimoire were
	  updated to earlier in the day (no sorcery 0.1.7), and this will probably
	  be the last one before my test ISOs go gcc3.

2002-05-28 Adam Clark <adamsgl@dhbit.ca> and Wyatt Draggoo <wyatt@draggoo.com>
	* Whaddaya know, a bunch of work between Wyatt and myself, and voila, the
	  ISO gets into a bit better shape!
	* There's now a -2 test ISO for today, and it's smaller than -1.

2002-05-27 Adam Clark <adamsgl@dhbit.ca> and Wyatt Draggoo <wyatt@draggoo.com>
	* Had a chance to do a bunch of work on the test ISO today, and now we've
	  got an ISO that's up-to-date and has been tested to work.

2002-05-07 Adam Clark <adamsgl@dhbit.ca>
	* I decided to get a bunch of things with my test ISO cleaned up, and the
	  results of a little bit of work are now available at:
	  http://smgl.bccs.net/adam-test-isos
	* I've also posted the changes that were made since the 0416-2 ISO so that
	  everyone's clear about what has been done.

2002-04-23 Adam Clark <adamsgl@dhbit.ca>
	* In an effort to learn a little bit about the install ISO and to see if I
	  could put things together perhaps to help the SGL ISO effort out, I came
	  up with a muchly updated ISO, which surprisingly enough, worked on my own
	  system.
	* This new ISO uses kernel 2.4.18, sorcery and the grimoire are up-to-date
	  as of April 16, the CD installs from a bzip2'ed tarball instead of direct
	  file copying (to save on all the CD-ROM head thrashing), "sorcery
	  rebuild" shouldn't have any problems currently, and hopefully the

	  "Source Mage GNU/Linux", don't take too much into that yet... I was just
	  going by the website vote.
	* Lastly, I did contact Wyatt about this as soon as I had made the ISO on
	  the 16th, yet I haven't heard from him or seen him online since then - I
	  did want to make it known that I wasn't trying to create anything to
	  'compete' or otherwise distract from the official SGL ISO... I just did
	  a few things to freshen up the ISO a bit and if people want a copy of it,
	  well, great.  =)
