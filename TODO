====================================
Things to do in order to achieve 0.1
====================================

-------------------
--   cauldron    --
-------------------
* finish writing the cauldron script so it actually does the steps needed
	- setup sorcery in build chroot (ARCHIVE=on, etc.)
	- perform the build
	- clean the chroot out (cleaners)
	- add installer(s)
	- extra sanity checks on boot and etc in chroot (add_sauce stuff for
	  those familiar with the 0.10 series)
	- switch initramfs to use busybox
		o will need a scrubbed busybox config for this
* write code to set up the init process on the ISO
	- this needs to be sensitive to what installers are present
* add optional feature to either cast from scratch for the iso/system or pick
  up where we left off from a previous run (in case of failed spells)
* create a man page for the cauldron command explaining how to use it and what
  files it uses

-------------------
--  enchantment  --
-------------------
* still need the installers themselves to be written
	- for the shell installer, this is trivial (mostly done)
	- the menu installer needs to be written
		~ Not sure if this should really be for 0.1, but a lot of
		  people have asked for it already.
	- i18n
		o translate error messages, instructions, etc. and implement an
		  easy way of calling them based on what language is selected
		  ($ENCHANT_LANGUAGE in the config file, plus either a file
		  suffix (errorcodes.en) or a separate dir (en/errorcodes) for
		  each language supported) - the framework is mostly in place,
		  now we need translators
		o display (fonts): fbterm + fontconfig + freetype2
		o input: uim (uim-fep) + m17n-lib + m17n-db
* create a man page for the enchantment command explaining how to use it and
  what files it uses

-------------------
--    general    --
-------------------
* LOTS AND LOTS OF TESTING!
* More sanity checks and error testing (use liberror!)
	- this is done, but could be more complete
	- currently errors are emitted, but they aren't yet really handled - we
	  want them handled at higher levels, because how an error is displayed
	  to the user will partly depend on what installer they are currently
	  using, but we shouldn't really "ignore" the errors at the lower
	  levels either
	- we need to determine at what levels which errors are really fatal,
	  which errors are warnings, and which errors are more informational
	  debug messages - once we determine all this we can start properly
	  handling, passing, or ignoring errors

====================
Things to do for 1.0
====================

* No (known) bugs
* web installer (html), X installer? (xdirectfb?)
* net install (tftp, ssh, etc.?)
* ???
