====================================
Things to do in order to achieve 0.1
====================================

* finish writing the cauldron script so it actually does the steps needed
	- setup sorcery in build chroot (ARCHIVE=on, etc.)
	- perform the build
	- clean the chroot out (cleaners)
	- add installer(s)
	- extra sanity checks on boot and etc in chroot (add_sauce stuff)
* set up how to do chroots in libcauldron (${CAULDRON_CHROOT}) (mostly done)
* write code to install sorcery into the CAULDRON_BUILD chroot
* write a cauldron spell so that cauldron can install itself
* write code to set up the init process on the ISO
	- this needs to be sensitive to what installers are present
* still need the installers themselves to be written
	- for the shell installer, this is trivial (mostly done)
	- the menu installer needs to be written
		~ Not sure if this should really be for 0.1, but a lot of
		  people have asked for it already.
* LOTS AND LOTS OF TESTING!
* More sanity checks and error testing (use liberror!)
	- liberror should get a function liberror_chkerror or something, which
	  will take an error code and do different things depending on the
	  debug level, etc.

====================
Things to do for 1.0
====================

* No (known) bugs
* web installer (html), X installer? (xdirectfb?)
* ???
