====================================
Things to do in order to achieve 0.1
====================================

-------------------
--   cauldron    --
-------------------
* finish writing the cauldron script so it actually does the steps needed
	- setup sorcery in build chroot (ARCHIVE=on, etc.)
	- extra sanity checks on boot and etc in chroot (add_sauce stuff for
	  those familiar with the 0.10 series)
		o this should be done in ward and liberror
* write code to set up the init process on the ISO
	- this may need to be sensitive to what installers are present
* add optional feature to either cast from scratch for the iso/system or pick
  up where we left off from a previous run (in case of failed spells)
	- automatic inter-dependency resolution for the different stages of the
	  ISO generation
* create a man page for the cauldron command explaining how to use it and what
  files it uses

-------------------
--  enchantment  --
-------------------
* still need the installers themselves to be written
	- for the shell installer, this is trivial (mostly done)
		o implement the hooks to use lib.potion
		o implement tab completion specific for the installer commands
		  (no need for a full-blown bash-completion installation, which
		  would add bloat; implementing tab completion only for the
		  installer would be pretty small and fast) - see 1.0 below
	- the menu installer needs to be written
		~ Not sure if this should really be for 0.1, but a lot of
		  people have asked for it already.
		o needs to be implemented via a good abstracted API or not at
		  all - maintaining a mess of dialog calls with it's plethora
		  of command-line option requirements is a nightmare
	- i18n
		o translate error messages, instructions, etc. and implement an
		  easy way of calling them based on what language is selected
		  ($ENCHANT_LANGUAGE in the config file, plus either a file
		  suffix (errorcodes.en) or a separate dir (en/errorcodes) for
		  each language supported) - the framework is mostly in place,
		  now we need translators
		o display (fonts): fbterm + fontconfig + freetype2
			> might be too big due to the size of the fonts, but no
			  other way to really have an internationalized ISO -
			  maybe have both a "core" ISO that lacks true i18n and
			  a full i18n ISO as official
		o input: uim (uim-fep) + m17n-lib + m17n-db
			> only useful if display is also in place

-------------------
--    general    --
-------------------
* LOTS AND LOTS OF TESTING!
* More sanity checks and error testing (use liberror!)
	- this is done, but could be more complete
	- currently errors are emitted, but they aren't yet really handled - we
	  want them handled at higher levels, because how an error is displayed
	  to the user will partly depend on what installer they are currently
	  using, but we shouldn't really "ignore" the errors at the lower
	  levels either
	- we need to determine at what levels which errors are really fatal,
	  which errors are warnings, and which errors are more informational
	  debug messages - once we determine all this we can start properly
	  handling, passing, or ignoring errors

===============================
Things to do for 1.0 (or later)
===============================

* No (known) bugs
* cauldron "possess" command for taking possession of a machine under another
  distro (don't generate install media, since the host system itself will be
  the install media)
* simple tab-completion for enchantment (CLI) and all its subcommands?
* web installer (html), X installer? (xdirectfb?)
* net install (tftp, ssh, etc.?) called "voodoo"
* ???
