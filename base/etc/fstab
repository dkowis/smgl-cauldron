# The schema is
# <device> <mountpoint> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>
# and is roughly executed as
# mount -t <type> -o <options> <device> <mountpoint>

# <device> may be specified either as an explicit device file (e.g.
# /dev/sda1) or using a UUID label (e.g. LABEL=boot). Note that if you
# use a UUID label, that label present for the filesystem this can be
# done using the filesystem tools, depending on what filesystem you
# format a partition with

# Note that, except for /, these need to be in "logical order" -
# if you have both /usr and /usr/local, put /usr before /usr/local

# For more information, see "man 5 fstab" from the man-pages spell.
# also see fstab.examples for more examples from the smgl community.
