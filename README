This directory contains the *development* version of the ISO, installer, and
general cauldron tools.

If you would like to contribute to Cauldron development, please read HACKING
and API first. DESIGN will explain the general principles motivating how
Cauldron is set up and the general processes involved in building an ISO and
installing from one.

If you are looking for an area that you can contribute to, feel free to read
TODO, or ask around in #sourcemage-cauldron on irc.freenode.net.
