This is the documentation of the file /etc/smgl-isogen.conf .
This is meant to be a per-host configuration file to override the settings
set by default in the perforce version. It is plain bash code.
It is to be on the host system, the same tree as the perforce mirror is in,
not the chroot.

The following variables are common to be defined (defaults in []):

ISO_BRANCH [devel]
  An internal variable to specify the ISO branch (devel, test, rc, stable)
  Used only in pattern decisions

ARCH [i486-pc-linux-gnu]
  A variable to specify what architecture the cache tarballs are built for
  (specifying the name to look for)

ISO_ARCH [x86]
  A variable to change the internal behavior of the scripts, building an ISO
  for a different architecture. Currently known are x86, ppc, and x86_64.
  Currently supported is only x86, but we're working on it.

SVERSION [stable]
  This variable globally specifies what sorcery the chroot should be using as
  well as what grimoire the ISO should install (those should not differ)

GVERSION [test]
  This variable specifies the grimoire version to use. Rest same as SVERSION.

KVERSION [2.6]
  This variable is meant as a switch for building kernels for different ISOs.
  It does nothing yet, though.

KERNEL_VERSION [2.6.12.5, changing rapidly]
  Specifies what kernel version to use for the ISO and which one the ISO should
  install as well. We don't support any patches but maintenance patches.

ISO_VERSION [devel-YYYYMMDDHH]
  Version string for the ISO. Appears in various files and in the ISO name.

IGNORE_FATAL [yes]
  Specifies whether the ISO should try to continue on grave errors
  (e.g. caches for spells that should be on the ISO not found)
