12 (Easy) Steps to Generate an ISO

Hi. My name is Hank, and I'm an addict. :-P

The following are the general steps that need to be taken in order to create an
ISO from scratch. These are not necessarily the steps that have to be followed,
but this is how I generate ISOs. Steps 11 and 12 are more necessary if you are
building an official ISO, but at least step 11 is recommended even for home
use. Before doing anything in the recipe, you will need a working kitchen. Get
yourself a cauldron to brew in (and check out the test branch):


git clone git://scm.sourcemage.org/smgl/cauldron.git

cd cauldron

git checkout -b test origin/test

All cauldron ISO scripts (for the test ISOs) are located in the cauldron/scripts dir.

1.  Get a fresh basesystem tarball, unpack it into a directory, and rename that
    directory "build".

2.  Build a linux kernel and modules, however you choose to do so (manually or
    by casting the linux spell). We have a kernel config that you can use in
    our git repo. (cauldron/data/config-2.6)

3.  Cast all the spells that will go on the ISO (required and optional) via
    cauldron/scripts/spellcaster.sh build x86. The list of standard x86 spells
    to cast for the official x86 isos can be found in the repo in
    cauldron/data/rspells.x86 (required), cauldron/data/ispells.x86 (iso), and
    cauldron/data/ospells.x86 (optional). Note: the terms "required" and
    "optional" here refer to what is required vs. optional for the user to
    install onto the target system. All spells are required to be on official
    ISOs. Also, only the required spells should be in the final system.tar.bz2,
    and optional spells should only be present on the ISO itself.

4.  Check the iso and sys trees for sanity. Especially make sure that all
    the requisite directories are present (smgl-fhs) and there is nothing
    astray in their etc/ directories. Some of this will be taken care of in
    steps #5 and #7 via the use of the cauldron/scripts/add-sauce.sh script.

5.  Make any necessary adjustments to the system tree (/tmp/cauldron/sys). This
    includes running cauldron/scripts/ add-sauce.sh -s /tmp/cauldron/sys and
    cleaning up var/cache/sorcery and var/spool/sorcery (e.g. via cleanse),
    removing linux source trees in /usr/src, and creating a symlink to the
    latest linux source under /var/spool/sorcery e.g., ln -sf /
    var/spool/sorcery/linux-VERSION.tar.bz2 /usr/src/ for easy access.

6.  Prune the iso tree (/tmp/cauldron/iso). The iso does not need a build
    environment, so (most of) the build tools can be completely wiped from the
    ISO. This can be done by running cauldron/scripts/cleaniso.sh -a
    /path/to/iso/tree.

7.  Make adjustments to the iso tree (/tmp/cauldron/iso) by running
    cauldron/scripts/add-sauce.sh -i /tmp/cauldron/iso.

8.  Make a compressed tarball of the system tree, and copy it to
    /tmp/cauldron/iso/system.tar.bz2. Creation of the tarball can be done
    easily by running cauldron/scripts/mksystem.sh /tmp/cauldron/sys
    /tmp/cauldron/iso/system.tar.bz2. Don't forget to copy the tarball to the
    iso tree after creating it if you save it to a path other than the root of
    the iso tree!

9.  Make an initrd, and copy it to cauldron/iso/boot/initrd.gz. This can be
    done via cauldron/scripts/mkinitrd.sh /path/to/iso/tree iso_kernel_version
    (where iso_kernel_version is, for example, 2.6.22; just make sure it
    matches the /path/to/iso/tree/lib/modules/iso_kernel_version name).

10. Generate the iso (i.e. mkisofs) and compress. If you are making a custom
    ISO, then you may find cauldron/scripts/mkiso.sh useful. However, for
    official releases, you can do cauldron/scripts/mkrelease.sh
    /path/to/iso/tree VERSION (e.g., cauldron/scripts/mkrelease.sh iso
    0.10.0-test5). This will give you both a compressed and uncompressed
    finished product. You can use the uncompressed ISO for immediate testing,
    and if it works, you can go ahead and ship the compressed version.

11. TEST the ISO (minimally in a VM). Go through a full install, following all
    of the steps, and try to catch anything out of the ordinary. Make sure the
    directions for the steps make sense and produce something that works, to
    the best of your ability.

12. Assuming everything worked, it's time for a release. Go through and make
    sure (again) that all the files are as they should be (especially in /etc
    and /var). You can run cauldron/scripts/add-sauce.sh again (it will ask
    before overwriting any files, for all files that already exist which it
    wants to write). There will eventually be another script that will go
    through and sanity-check an iso (i.e. the script is in progress). If
    everything is as it should be and the iso worked as expected during
    testing, release it. Congratulations.
