in the preceding path get used, while @ refers only to the files mentioned in
the description.

/etc/sourcemage_version
  file to specify installer version and to identify CD to the initrd

  a copy of the grimoire to use

/var/state/sorcery/depends

  such as would be created by casting every spell and
  dispel --no-reap-depends'ing it again.

/var/state/sorcery/packages
  a /v/s/s/packages covering every optional and required spell,
  even those conflicting with each other. You need to create this one
  manually/through a script. Sorcery provides no way to get this, why should it.
