[1mdisk-partition step[m
First, we'll need to create some partitions on your disk that we can install
SMGL to. You'll need to know the device of your hard disk to do this
(TODO: describe how to find that out).

This image ships with several popular programs for partitioning:

cfdisk is probably the most popular, a curses-based menu system:
[1m cfdisk /dev/hda[m

parted can resize partitions, but may be a tad confusing:
[1m parted /dev/hda[m

Then for the purists there's plain line-based fdisk. Can be a bit hard to use:
[1m fdisk /dev/hda[m

The iso also ships with [1msfdisk[m, if you're insane enough to want to use
it.

Remember to save your new partitioning scheme before quitting the program,
create a swap partition, and remember you can always see this screen again
by typing [1mtodo[m. Type [1mnext[m when you're done.
