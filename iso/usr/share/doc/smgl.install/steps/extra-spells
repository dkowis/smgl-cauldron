[1mextra-spells step[m
At this point, you may install any extra spells you desire. These
exist as bzip2-compressed tarballs (sorcery caches). You can either
install these manually, or run the following script to do it for you.
If you mounted your harddisk to a location other than /mnt/root, then
you can specify that location as an argument to the script.

Using default location:
[1m smgl-spellcaster[m

Example for some other location:
[1m smgl-spellcaster /mnt/some-dir[m

When you are finished, type [1mnext[m to go to the next step.
