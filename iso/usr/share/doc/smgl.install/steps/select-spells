[1mselect-spells step[m
You may now select the spells you would like that are provided on the ISO.
There are currently two ways that you can accomplish this. Both methods make
use of /tmp/spells. Note that it is crucial to install some spells (such as a
bootloader) or your system may not function, so some of these have been
included as defaults in /tmp/spells.

text menu:
[1m smgl-spells[m

manual:
[1m $EDITOR /tmp/spells[m

You can of course use any editor you like, in case you haven't set $EDITOR.

You can re-edit /tmp/spells any time during the install session and it will
remember your changes each time. Likewise, you may re-run [1msmgl-spells[m.

When you are finished selecting your spells, type [1mnext[m.
