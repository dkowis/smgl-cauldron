[1mselect-spells step[m
You may now select the spells you would like that are provided on the ISO.
There are currently two ways that you can accomplish this. Both methods make
use of /tmp/spells. It is crucial to install some spells (such as a bootloader)
or your system may not function, so some of these have been included as
defaults in /tmp/spells. [1mNOTE:[m the ISO caches represent ALL spells installed
for the ISO runtime, and are selectable for install, regardless of whether they
are also included in system.tar.bz2 as well - gcc, glibc, bash, etc. are
available both in system.tar.bz2 AND in the ISO's /var/cache/sorcery/
directory. For a list of the spells in system.tar.bz2, see /tmp/rspells.

You can of course use any editor you like, in case you haven't set $EDITOR.

You can re-edit /tmp/spells any time during the install session and it will
remember your changes each time. Likewise, you may re-run [1msmgl-spells[m.

When you are finished selecting your spells, type [1mnext[m.
