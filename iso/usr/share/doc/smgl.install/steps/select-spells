[1mselect-spells step[m
You may now select the spells you would like that are provided on the ISO.
There are currently two ways that you can accomplish this. Both methods make
use of /tmp/opt-spells. Note that it is crucial to install some spells (such as
a bootloader) or your system may not function, so some of these have been
included as defaults in /tmp/opt-spells.

The menu will present a list of the spells available on the ISO, as well as
mark which ones are selected for install. The menu is accessed as follows.

menu:
[1m alchemy[m

manual:
[1m $EDITOR /tmp/opt-spells[m

You can of course use any editor you like, in case you haven't set $EDITOR.

You can re-edit /tmp/opt-spells any time during the install session and it will
remember your changes each time. Likewise, you may re-run [1malchemy[m.

When you are finished selecting your spells, type [1mnext[m.
