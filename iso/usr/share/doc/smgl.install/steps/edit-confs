Now, we need to set up our partitions so the system will find them again on
bootup. For this, edit [1m/mnt/root/etc/fstab[m and add your partitions.

(For editors available on this iso, do [1mhelp editors[m)

Also, take a look at the files in [1m/mnt/root/etc/sysconfig/[m and edit any you
feel should be different. Especially, if you selected a custom keymap at the
start of this install, you'll need to edit the file called [1mkeymap[m
in that directory (do [1m cat /tmp/selected-keymap[m to see which you chose)

Type [1mnext[m to go to the boot-loader selection step.
