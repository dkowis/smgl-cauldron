Now, we need to set up our partitions so the system will find them again on
bootup. For this, edit [1m/mnt/root/etc/fstab[m and add your partitions.

(For editors available on this iso, do [1mhelp editors[m)

Also, take a look at the files in [1m/mnt/root/etc/sysconfig/[m and edit any you
feel should be different. Especially, if you selected a custom keymap at the
start of this install, you'll need to edit the file called [1mkeymap[m
in that directory (do [1m cat /tmp/selected-keymap[m to see which you chose)

You may also wish to create [1m/mnt/root/etc/hostname[m with a hostname for your
system, and you can set up networking by editing the
[1m/mnt/root/etc/network/interfaces[m file.

Finally, you can choose to set your timezone by doing the following:
[1m smgl-chroot[m
[1m ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/SOME/TIMEZONE /etc/localtime[m

Just remember to replace "SOME/TIMEZONE" with your actual timezone.

Type [1mnext[m to go to the next step.
