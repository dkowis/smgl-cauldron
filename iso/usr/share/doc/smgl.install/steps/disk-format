[1mdisk-format step[m
Now create filesystems on the partitions you just created. Below is a list
of example commands for the different types of filesystems supported on this
ISO. The partitions given are examples. Be sure to format all the partitions
you need.

mke2fs /dev/hda1
mkfs.ext3 /dev/hda1
mkreiserfs /dev/hda1
mkfs.jfs /dev/hda1
mkfs.xfs /dev/hda1

# swap:
mkswap /dev/hda2

The reiser4 tools are provided on the ISO. However, the ISO kernel does not
yet support reiser4, so although you can create reiser4 filesystems and
check ones already created, you cannot yet mount them. Only make a reiser4
filesystem if you really know what you are doing.

mkfs.reiser4
