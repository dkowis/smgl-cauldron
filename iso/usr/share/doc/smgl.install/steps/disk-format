Now, we need to create filesystems on the partitions you just created.
Preferences for filesystems differ, and we're not here to tell you which you
should use (should we?), so here's just a list of commands to create the
different filesystems I know about:

mke2fs /dev/hda1
# This one is the same as mke2fs -j /dev/hda1
mkfs.ext3 /dev/hda1
# big TODO: seems we don't actually ship this yet 8)
# We do now :-D
mkreiserfs /dev/hda1
# same for xfs and jfs
mkfs.jfs /dev/hda1
mkfs.xfs /dev/hda1

We do provide support for reiser4 on the ISO. However, the ISO kernel does
not yet support reiser4, so although you can create reiser4 filesystems and
check ones already created, you cannot yet mount them. Only make a reiser4
filesystem if you really know what you are doing.

mkfs.reiser4

# swap:
mkswap /dev/hda2
