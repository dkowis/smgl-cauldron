Now, we need to create filesystems on the partitions you just created.
Preferences for filesystems differ, and we're not here to tell you which you
should use (should we?), so here's just a list of commands to create the
different filesystems I know about:

mke2fs /dev/hda1
# This one is the same as mke2fs -j /dev/hda1
mkfs.ext3 /dev/hda1
# big TODO: seems we don't actually ship this yet 8)
mkfs.reiserfs /dev/hda1
# same for xfs and jfs

# swap:
mkswap /dev/hda2

Now, you need to mount the filesystems. We'll be installing to /mnt/root,
so mount the filesystem that will be / as
mount -t ext2 /dev/hda1 /mnt/root
Then mount the others.

Don't forget to turn on swap via
swapon /dev/hda2
