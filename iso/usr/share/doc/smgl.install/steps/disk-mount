[1mdisk-mount step[m
You need to mount the filesystems. We'll be installing to /mnt/root,
so mount the filesystem that will be / onto /mnt/root. The partitions given are
only examples. Replace them with the partitions you used in [1mdisk-format[m.

Examples:
[1m mount -t ext2 /dev/hda1 /mnt/root[m
[1m mount -t reiserfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/root[m
[1m mount -t xfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/root[m

Then mount any other partitions you made at the proper subdirectories.
You'll probably need to make directories for the other mount points first
(assuming you formatted the / partition). Make sure you mount / first.

For example, if you created /dev/hda2 for /usr:
[1m mkdir /mnt/root/usr[m
[1m mount -t ext2 /dev/hda2 /mnt/root/usr[m
(or, for example, if it's a jfs partition)
[1m mount -t jfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/root[m

Don't forget to mount [1mall[m the (system) partitions you plan to use.
Also, you may want to turn on swap via e.g.
[1m swapon /dev/hda2[m
