[1mdisk-mount step[m
Now, you need to mount the filesystems. We'll be installing to /mnt/root,
so mount the filesystem that will be / onto /mnt/root.

Examples:
mount -t ext2 /dev/hda1 /mnt/root
mount -t ext3 /dev/hda1 /mnt/root
mount -t reiserfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/root
mount -t jfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/root
mount -t xfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/root

Then mount any other partitions you made at the proper subdirectories.
You'll probably need to make directories for the other mount points first
(assuming you just formatted the / partition). Make sure you mount / first.

For example, if you created /dev/hda2 for /usr:
mkdir /mnt/root/usr
mount -t ext2 /dev/hda2 /mnt/root/usr

Don't forget to mount [1mall[m the (system) partitions you plan to use.

Don't forget to turn on swap via
swapon /dev/hda2
