[1muser-setup step[m
Finally, we need to give the root user a password and probably create an user
for you to do your daily work with.

To set up users, you'll want to chroot into the target system again, as you
already did to install the bootloader:
[1msmgl-chroot[m

Set up a password for the root user (pick a secure one, but not one you'll
forget. Also, bear in mind that it can be bypassed with a screwdriver.):
[1mpasswd root[m

If you would like to add additional users at this time, you may feel free
to do so by typing the following:
[1museradd -d /home/mbolton -m [m-g users[1m mbolton[m
[1mpasswd mbolton[m

Of course, you may not want to be called mbolton, so replace that with whatever
login you want.

Finally, exit the chroot to return to the installer:
[1mexit[m
