[1muser-setup step[m
Set up a password for the root user:

mount --bind /dev /mnt/root/dev
mount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/root/dev/pts
mount --bind /proc /mnt/root/proc
chroot /mnt/root /bin/bash
passwd root

If you would like to add additional users at this time, you may feel free
to do so by typing the following:

useradd -m USERNAME

Replace USERNAME with the username you want to add. After you are done,
make sure you exit the chroot:

exit

Make sure it is a reasonably secure password, but not one you will forget.
