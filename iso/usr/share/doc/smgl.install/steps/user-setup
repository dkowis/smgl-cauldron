[1muser-setup step[m
First, chroot into the target platform. We provide a wrapper command that
will help set up the chroot for you. It outputs messages about what it is
doing by default. If you don't want to see these messages, pass the -q
option (for quiet)

Example:
/usr/bin/smgl-chroot
/usr/bin/smgl-chroot -q

Set up a password for the root user:
passwd root

If you would like to add additional users at this time, you may feel free
to do so by typing the following:
useradd -g 1000 -b /home -m USERNAME
passwd USERNAME

Replace USERNAME with the username you want to add. After you are done,
make sure you exit the chroot:
exit

Make sure it is a reasonably secure password, but not one you will forget.
