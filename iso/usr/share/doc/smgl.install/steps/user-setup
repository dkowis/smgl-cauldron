[1muser-setup step[m
To set up users, chroot into the target system as for the bootloader step:
[1m smgl-chroot[m

Set a password for the root user (pick a secure one, but not one you'll forget,
and bear in mind that it can be bypassed with a screwdriver):
[1m passwd root[m

[1mRecommended[m: add at least one regular user for daily use:
[1m useradd -d /home/mbolton -m [m-g users[1m mbolton[m
[1m passwd mbolton[m

Replace mbolton with whatever login you want. Don't forget to change
/home/mbolton accordingly. You may also change the group (-g users).

[1mWARNING[m: The default /etc/login.defs from the shadow spell makes use of
/etc/securetty to determine which devices root is allowed to login on, but does
not provide /etc/securetty by default. To login as root on consoles, either
turn this feature off in /etc/login.defs, or create /etc/securetty and list the
devices you want (e.g. /dev/tty1).

Finally, exit the chroot to return to the installer:
[1m exit[m
