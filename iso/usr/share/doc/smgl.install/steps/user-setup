[1muser-setup step[m
To set up users, chroot into the target system as for the bootloader step:
[1m smgl-chroot[m

Set a password for the root user (pick a secure one, but not one you'll forget,
and bear in mind that it can be bypassed with a screwdriver):
[1m passwd root[m

[1mRecommended[m: add at least one regular user for daily use:
[1m useradd -m -d /home/mbolton [m-g users[1m mbolton[m
[1m passwd mbolton[m

Replace mbolton with whatever login you want. Don't forget to change
/home/mbolton accordingly. You may also change the group (-g users).

Finally, exit the chroot to return to the installer:
[1m exit[m
