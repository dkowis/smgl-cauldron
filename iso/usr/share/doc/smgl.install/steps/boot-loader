[1mboot-loader step[m
Now it is time to select a boot-loader. Since this is the x86 ISO, you can
choose either grub or lilo. Both are included in the basesystem you copied
over to /mnt/root in the copy-base step. Since grub seems to be more popular
than lilo these days, the installer defaults to grub. Use whichever you please,
but only use one of them.

Once you have decided which boot loader to use, you need to configure the
boot loader. After you finish configuring your boot loader, you need to
"install" it.  This involves running the boot loader, which will install itself
to the location you specified in the config file.

For lilo instructions, type [1mjump lilo[m.

For grub instructions, just type [1mnext[m.
