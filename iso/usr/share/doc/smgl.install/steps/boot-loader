[1mboot-loader step[m
Now it is time to select a boot-loader. Since this is the x86 ISO, you can
choose either grub or lilo. Both are included in the basesystem you copied
over to /mnt/root in the copy-base step.

Once you have decided which boot loader to use, you need to configure the
boot loader. For lilo, this is done by editing /mnt/root/etc/lilo.conf. For
grub, follow the instructions below. The grub instructions are for
installing grub to the MBR of the first hdd (e.g. /dev/hda). Change this
according to your setup/needs.

After you finish configuring your boot loader, you need to "install" it.
This simply involves running the boot loader, which will install itself to
the location you specified in the config file.

For lilo instructions, type [1mbranch lilo[m.

For grub instructions, type [1mbranch grub[m.
