You should be all done with the installation! Congratulations!

Now it is time to umount all of your partitions. For all partitions you mounted
under /mnt/root, unmount them, starting with the deepest mount first and
working back up to /mnt/root.

Example - assume that there are separate partitions for /, /var, /var/spool,
and /var/cache:

umount /mnt/root/var/cache
umount /mnt/root/var/spool
umount /mnt/root/var
umount /mnt/root

You should be able to reboot now.
Don't forget to take out the CD before the machine boots back up!
