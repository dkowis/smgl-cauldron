[1mreboot step[m
You should be all done with the installation! Congratulations! Time to reboot
into your installed system!

The paranoid way: umount all of your partitions and then reboot. For all
partitions you mounted under /mnt/root, unmount them, starting with the deepest
mount first and working back up to /mnt/root. Example - assume that there are
separate partitions for /, /var, /var/spool, and /var/cache:

[1m umount /mnt/root/var/cache[m
[1m umount /mnt/root/var/spool[m
[1m umount /mnt/root/var[m
[1m umount /mnt/root[m
[1m swapoff /dev/hda2[m (change hda2 to your swap partition)

Now, reboot via something like:
[1m shutdown -r now "install finished"[m

The less-paranoid and easier way: just type [1mreboot[m.

We don't (yet) eject the CD during shutdown, so be sure to take it out during
reboot or configure your BIOS not to try and boot from it.
