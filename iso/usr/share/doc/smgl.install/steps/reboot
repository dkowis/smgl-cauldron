You should be all done with the installation! Congratulations!

Now it is time to umount all of your partitions. For all partitions you mounted
under /mnt/root, unmount them, starting with the deepest mount first and
working back up to /mnt/root.

Example - assume that there are separate partitions for /, /var, /var/spool,
and /var/cache:

umount /mnt/root/var/cache
umount /mnt/root/var/spool
umount /mnt/root/var
umount /mnt/root

Now, reboot via something like
[1mshutdown -r now "install finished"[m

We don't (yet) eject the CD during shutdown, so be sure to take it out during
reboot or configure your BIOS not to try and boot from it.
