[1mgrub instructions[m:
First, chroot into the target platform. We provide a wrapper command that
will help set up the chroot for you. It outputs messages about what it is
doing by default. If you don't want to see these messages, pass the -q
option (for quiet)

Example:
/usr/bin/smgl-chroot
/usr/bin/smgl-chroot -q

Then run grub so you can update the boot record:
/sbin/grub
> root (hd0,0)
> setup (hd0)
> quit

Exit the chroot:
exit

Unless you got an error message when you were installing the boot loader,
you should be done with this step. Type [1mnext[m to go to the next
step.
