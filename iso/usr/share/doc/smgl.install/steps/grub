[1mgrub step[m:
To run grub properly, it needs to be chroot'ed into the new system. This needs
some directories (/dev, /proc), so we provide a wrapper to set those up for
you and clean them up again when you're done.

Run the script to get a shell inside the installed system:
[1m smgl-chroot[m

Then run grub so you can update the boot record (TODO: use grub-install here?):
[1m /sbin/grub[m

You'll get a grub shell, where you need to enter the following commands,
without the > in front (adjust for your disk layout):
> [1mroot (hd0,0)[m
> [1msetup (hd0)[m
> [1mquit[m

Exit the chroot:
[1m exit[m

Unless you got an error message when you were installing the boot loader,
you should be done with this step. Type [1mnext[m to go to the next step.
