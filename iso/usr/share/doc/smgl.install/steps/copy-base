Now, it's time to set up the basic smgl installation.
Don't forget to mount any partitions you need first (this depends on your
partition scheme; i.e. if you have a separate partition that you intend to
mount as /var, mount that now). You may need to create the directories for
the mount points you intend to mount.

Run the following command:
[1mtar -xjvf /system.tar.bz2 -C /mnt/root[m
(if BearPerson gets his lazy ass in gear, we might have an alias for this
soon to cut down on typing)

If you don't need to see output rushing by to give you the feeling that
something is going on, leave out the [1mv[m (turning [1m-xjvf[m into [1m-xjf[m)
to make tar shut up unless there's errors.

When the command has completed, type [1mnext[m as usual.
