Welcome to the SMGL 0.10.0-devel install CD!

The install process is currently a guided shell prompt. Type [1mnext[m to start.
Everytime you finish a step, enter [1mnext[m to advance to the next one.
If you want to re-read the documentation for a step, type [1mtodo[m.
You can enter [1mback[m at any time to jump to the previous step.

If you ever get lost, type [1msteps[m to get a list of installer steps,
and e.g. [1mjump copy-base[m to jump to a specific step.

Don't worry, there's no magic attached to the steps, you can jump between
them as you please without breaking anything.

If at any time you need help, type [1mhelp[m.
To see this message again, type [1mwelcome[m.
