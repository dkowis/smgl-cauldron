Building the 0.9.3 ISO:
-----------------------

This is a step by step instructions on how the 0.9.3 ISO has been built,
both on x86 and ppc architecture.

- you need a working chroot system in $IMAGE
  export IMAGE=/Your/Chroot

- you need to have sorcery-stable.tar.bz2 (sorcery)
  and stable.tar.bz2 in the current directory (grimoire).
  They are later needed by mk-iso-root. You can download
  everything with:
  ./mk-init

- create a work/initrd directory
  mkdir -p work/initrd

- create the initrd image
  ./mk-initrd

  - this will create a work/initrd.gz which will be used later

- create a work/iso_root directory
  mkdir -p work/iso_root

- create the ISO content
  ./mk-iso-root

  - this script display the architecture it is using (i386 or ppc)
  - this script will carefully check that all needed spells are in the chroot
	and will use the version currently installed in the chroot
  - at the end, the directory work/iso_root is populated and ready

- create the ISO image
  ./mk-iso

  - this script will produce a iso/smgl-0.9.3-i386.iso
    file ready for burning
  - the version can be change in the "config" file.
