	* smgl.install: chmod 400 /etc/shadow

2004-04-14 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: fix list_parts and list_raid_parts so double digit 
		partitions don't cause errors. Change find_grub_target to 
		make and check for a specific file, or it "can" detect 
		another SMGL /boot partition.

2004-04-12 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* kernel.help: moved into a separate file that the installer reads, 
		it can be updated without affecting installer now.
	* smgl.install: simple hack if uptimed installed, and make maildir. 
		Made many menus radiolists so the choice was selectable 
		without hitting enter and closing the screen. Rerun grub if 
		reconfiguring, so it can be loaded to MBR if that option changes

2004-04-09 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: make some menus radiolist, so you can toggle 
		selection on and off reordered grub lilo stuff, removed 
		some unnecessary functions, slightly changed the partitioning 
		and raid hints for bootloader. check for deps of EDITOR and 
		install REAL_ED (onle nano and elvis in iso_root so EDITOR 
		and REAL_ED are different altered kernel compile hint.
	* bootmisc: the script with commands to free initrd memory for the 
		installer

2004-04-07 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: typos corrected, &&'s used to stop continuation when 
		menu is escaped	grub and lilo fixes, udev fixes, untracked 
		file fixes, change menu item for kernel so it is 
		escapable/cancellable; architecture, optimization menus fixed
	

2004-04-07 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* srcmage.txt: the txt file read by isolinux
	* isolinux.cfg: isolinux config
	* f1.txt: graphical modes readable from isolinux prompt
	* smgl.init: changes for 2.6 kernel modules
	* mountall.sh: Updated to work with Arweds %DEV runlevel
	* config-2.?.X: moving 2.4.25 and 2.6.5 configs into the spell dir
	* smgl.install: mucho bueno changes, probably too many for a single 
		submission, but ... ?
	Remove image.tar.bz2. Add two lists (etc/installerdata/*-list), one 
		with defaults and second with list of optional spells,all 
		spells (except fro some untracked files) installed from 
		/var/cache/sorcery/* . udev or static dev query (2.6 only). 
		choice of lilo or grub added to installer, dialog query of 
		whether to install  $bootloader to MBR or not. Reordered 
		entire installer to install spells after configutation. Run 
		all configuration after mounting drives, but before install, 
		setup_target installs sorcery, makes static /dev entries and 
		copies untracked files in hte background while the user	
		continues configuring. Fix ppp and pppoe configuration, offer 
		to start all configurable interfaces, after configuring them.
		Copy /etc/skel/* to /root/* of the new install. Change 
		list_parts (and list_raid_parts) so if finding size and type 
		fails it continues instead of failing. Make /dev/pts and 
		/dev/shm (in case static /dev is chosen). Move the raidtab 
		from /tmp to /etc, functions and menu to select services to 
		start at boot (the only post install item). Add vim to list 
		of editors, but for duration of install alias vim and jed to 
		elvis. Rename many, many variables from LINE and LIST (etc) 
		to be more reflective of their job. More debugging added, 
		some refinement.
	

2004-04-02 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.init: pivot_root fixes, making writable dirs and new cdrom 
		scan function to find the installer

2004-04-01 Kevin Dahan <unet@sourcemage.org>
	* added alternate-smgl.init with hwd

2004-03-25 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>

	VERSION and change location of the installation record file

2004-03-19 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: basic debugging, allows running through install 
		without running the destructive commands
	* smgl.install: forget the ${TARGET} prefix on a command, and netconf 
		fix
	* smgl.install: DEBUG checks reversed in two cases, move some debug 
		reporting out so it always gets recorded

2004-03-05 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: few polishing touches
	* sgml.init*: few polishing touches
	* install.guide: update for current installer.

2004-03-03 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: tested and works for both 2.4 series and 2.6 series
	* smgl.init-4_2.6: 2.6 version of the initrd's linuxrc needed a few 
		tweaks
	* MAKEDEV: actually add the script

2004-02-29 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* MAKEDEV: add a script and a few lines to installer to generate 
		static /dev entries

2004-02-25 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: added make jobs configuration to the optimisation 
		item, test and remove raidtools, show block counts for 
		partitions in the menu, remove spaces from the partition 
		lines, add some hints here and there about possible actions 
		within that screen. Change <cancel> to <Continue> for first 
		nls menu. modify uname output for the lilo generation
	
2004-02-23 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* mountall.sh-0.9.1: added the 0.9.1 version of this script
	* inittab: add this, not significantly different to the grimoire 
		version, but will save me generating it
	* /etc/*: add the raidlevel data and move things around so a cp will 
		work better

2004-02-22 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: need to test it but RAID should be functional from 
		the menu.

2004-02-20 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: RAID 90% added

2004-02-19 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install: add menu item for restarting install from scratch and 
		the restart_install function (tested and working)
	* smgl.install: correct some typos
	* smgl.install: begin adding code for raid device generation

2004-02-18 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* ALL: add some files not generated by any spell, and some that 
		differ from regular files (for iso_root)

2004-02-14 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* config-2.4.24: updated to make some stuff statically.
	* smgl.install-using*blablabla: remove, was a backup only.
	* smgl.install: change swap + RAM requirements to recommendations.
	* smgl.install: change swapfile generation to only be prompted if a 
		dedicated swap partition isn't found when system transfer 
		starts
	* kickstart-spell/*: some files needed to kickstart an installation.

2004-02-05 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* smgl.install 
		move fs dispelling to immediately post image transfer
		move passwd changing similarly
		add dispelling prompts for ppp and rp-pppoe
		comment out cast of rp-pppoe now pppoe is included in image 
		and add chroot_cmd adsl-setup for pppoe configuration, amazed 
		it was left broken for so long unset WASTAGE VAR incase 
		someone chooses the wrong menu, and also check it isn't an 
		empty var, or dispel just opens less and waits for input.

2004-01-26 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* added missing # to editor.sh and lc.sh script generation

2004-01-22 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* added smgl.install-using-proc-partitions-and-etc-profile.d-dir
		which starts using /proc/partitions for partitions and disks 
		(tested with a raid install today) also puts EDITOR and LANG 
		into .sh files in the /etc/profile.d/ directory so the test 
		spell can be integrated into stable soon.
	* I specifically made this a second file becuase I was worried Unet 
		might be working on the other one (I am happy to merge/ 
		change if he has)

2004-01-20 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* add smgl.install from 0.8.1 iso I made

2004-01-20 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* add the config for the kernel I built, has more options turned on 
		as modules. And some special features like raid fasttrak for 
		promise controllers that need it turned on to use disks the 
		bios can't see
