Scripts we use for creating an ISO

To be used from outside the chroot:
- Makefile: in theory, a "make iso" should let your box rumble for a day,
            and crank out a fully-built .iso in the end, no manual work needed
- config:   a bunch of configuration for the ISO
- mkprep:   resolves template stuff in the iso configuration files and copies
            them into the chroot. Use this to update/install the iso generation
            scripts into the chroot
- mkroot:   creates a new chroot

To be used inside the chroot:
- first_build: build all tarballs needed for the iso
- mk-smgl-iso: create a .iso from existing tarballs
- mkinitrd:    create only an initrd image
               (usually called via mk-smgl-iso)
- mkiso:       create a .iso from existing tarballs and initrd image
               (usually called via mk-smgl-iso)
