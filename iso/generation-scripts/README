Scripts we use for creating an ISO

To be used from outside the chroot:
- Makefile: in theory, a "make iso" should let your box rumble for a day,
            and crank out a fully-built .iso in the end, no manual work needed
- config:   a bunch of configuration for the ISO
- mkprep:   resolves template stuff in the iso configuration files and copies
            them into the chroot. Use this to update/install the iso generation
            scripts into the chroot
- mkroot:   creates a new chroot

To be used inside the chroot:
- first_build: build all tarballs needed for the iso
- mk-smgl-iso: create a .iso from existing tarballs
- mkinitrd:    create only an initrd image
               (usually called via mk-smgl-iso)
- mkiso:       create a .iso from existing tarballs and initrd image
               (usually called via mk-smgl-iso)


Old cruft, not to be used at all:
- autoupdate.sh: attempt to update the spells inside the chroot and generate a
                 new .iso - probably not working too well
- lint-packages.sh: run inside the chroot to try and find unsatisfied
                    dependencies from spells unpacked to the iso. Might come in
                    useful every once in a while, but not part of the regular
                    procedure. Should actually work.
